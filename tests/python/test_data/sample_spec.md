# Sample Test Feature Specification

## Overview

This is a sample specification file for testing purposes. It demonstrates the expected structure and content of a spec.md file used by the .zo scripts.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. The spec file must be written in Markdown format
2. The spec file must include standard sections (Overview, Requirements, Implementation)
3. The spec file must be parseable by the .zo scripts

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Specifications should be clear and concise
2. All sections should be properly formatted with Markdown headers
3. Code examples should use appropriate syntax highlighting

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Structure

- Create main sections with H1 headers
- Create subsections with H2/H3 headers
- Include bullet points for lists
- Include code blocks where appropriate

### Phase 2: Content

- Document feature behavior
- Include edge cases
- Provide examples
- Define acceptance criteria

### Phase 3: Validation

- Verify Markdown formatting
- Check section completeness
- Validate code examples
- Review for clarity

## Testing Considerations

When testing spec parsing:

1. Verify that all required sections are present
2. Check that headers are properly formatted
3. Validate that code blocks are correctly identified
4. Ensure that bullet points and lists are parsed correctly

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All required sections are present
- [ ] Headers follow the expected hierarchy
- [ ] Code examples are properly formatted
- [ ] The spec can be parsed by the .zo scripts
- [ ] Content is clear and unambiguous
