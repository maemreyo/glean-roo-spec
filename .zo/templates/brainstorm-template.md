## 🎯 Prioritization Matrix

| Idea | Impact | Effort | Risk | Priority | Rationale |
|------|--------|--------|------|----------|-----------|
| #[N] [Title] | 🔥🔥🔥 | [X]w | Low | **P0** | [Why must-have] |
| #[N] [Title] | 🔥🔥 | [X]w | Med | **P1** | [Why should-have] |
| #[N] [Title] | 🔥 | [X]w | High | **P2** | [Why nice-to-have] |
| #[N] [Title] | 🔥 | [X]w | High | **P3** | [Strategic bet] |

**Priority Definitions**:

- **P0 (Must-Have)**: Blocking user value OR critical technical foundation. Do first.
- **P1 (Should-Have)**: Significant competitive advantage OR major quality-of-life. Do if time allows.
- **P2 (Nice-to-Have)**: Future-proofing OR exploratory. Do after P0/P1 complete.
- **P3 (Strategic Bet)**: Long-term investment OR unvalidated hypothesis. Requires separate discovery phase.

**Critical Path**: [Which ideas block other ideas? What's the dependency chain?]

## ⏱️ Effort Reality Check

**Total Effort (Realistic Estimates)**: [X-Y engineering weeks]

**Breakdown by Type**:

- Blue Sky (Innovation): [X weeks]
- Bedrock (Foundation): [Y weeks]
- Strategic (Discovery): [Z weeks]

**Recommended Phasing** (for solo developer or small team):

### Phase 0: Research & Setup (Week 1-2)

- [ ] Design system audit
- [ ] Proof-of-concept for riskiest idea
- [ ] User interviews (if Strategic questions need validation)

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 3-[X])

**Goal**: Stable, boring infrastructure

- [ ] [Bedrock Idea 1]
- [ ] [Bedrock Idea 2]
- [ ] [Bedrock Idea 3]

**Why first**: You can't build Blue Sky features on shaky foundation.

### Phase 2: Differentiation (Week [X]-[Y])

**Goal**: Competitive "wow" factor

- [ ] [Top Blue Sky Idea]
- [ ] [Second Blue Sky Idea]

**Why second**: Foundation lets you move fast without breaking things.

### Phase 3: Scale & Polish (Week [Y]-[Z])

**Goal**: Handle growth, optimize

- [ ] [Third Blue Sky Idea OR Performance optimizations]
- [ ] [Template system / content leverage]

**Why third**: You have users to optimize for now.

### Phase 4: Strategic Bets (Week [Z]+)

**Goal**: Long-term positioning

- [ ] [Strategic Idea 1 - IF validated]
- [ ] [Strategic Idea 2 - IF validated]

**Why last**: These require market validation, can't force timing.

**Risk Mitigation**:

- ⚠️ Add 25% buffer to each phase (Murphy's Law)
- 🎯 Define 1 "escape hatch" per phase (what to cut if timeline slips)
- 🚨 Hard stop after Phase 2 if traction doesn't materialize

## 🚀 Recommended Next Steps

### Path A: Deep Dive on Specific Ideas → Feature Spec

**When**: You want detailed specifications for accepted ideas

```bash
# Option 1: Specify ALL accepted ideas
/zo.specify.idea all

# Option 2: Specify specific ideas by ID
/zo.specify.idea 1,3,5

# Option 3: With design system integration (RECOMMENDED for UI/UX features)
/zo.specify.idea 1,3,5 --design
```

### Path B: Start Implementation Planning

**When**: You're ready to break ideas into executable tasks

```bash
# Create implementation plan for specific ideas
/zo.plan idea:1 idea:2

# Or plan entire feature
/zo.plan [feature-name]
```

### Path C: Validate Strategic Questions First

**When**: You have open Strategic questions that need research before committing

**Available Options**:

1. **Deep-dive with git history and code analysis**:
   ```bash
   # Search for related patterns and past decisions
   git log --oneline --all --grep="[keyword]" | head -20
   
   # Analyze existing implementations
   grep -r "[keyword]" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" .
   ```

2. **Re-brainstorm with research focus**:
   ```bash
   /zo.brainstorm "research: [strategic question topic] - analyze competitors, user needs, and technical feasibility"
   ```

3. **Document research gaps in the Strategic Question itself**:
   - Add "What We Don't Know Yet" section with specific research questions
   - Create a separate research document in `docs/research/`
   - Link it from the strategic question
   ```markdown
   **Research Needed**:
   
   - See `docs/research/[topic]-analysis.md` for initial findings
   - Key question to answer: [specific question]
   ```

### Path D: Continue Exploring Alternatives

**When**: You want to explore variations before committing

```bash
# Brainstorm alternatives for specific idea
/zo.brainstorm "alternative approaches to idea #[N]"

# Or explore adjacent problem space
/zo.brainstorm "what if we approached [problem] from [different angle]"
```

### Path E: Quick Win - Start with Foundation

**When**: You want to ship something small to validate assumptions

**Recommended Quick Win** (Week 1-2):

1. Pick ONE Bedrock idea (usually highest priority)
2. Implement minimal viable version
3. Get user feedback before building more

```bash
# Specify just the foundation piece
/zo.specify.idea [bedrock-idea-id]
```

## 🎓 Decision Guide

**Still not sure which path?** Answer these questions:

1. **Do you have validated product-market fit?**

   - ✅ Yes → Path A or B (build features)
   - ❌ No → Path C (validate first)

2. **Are Strategic questions blocking P0 ideas?**

   - ✅ Yes → Path C (resolve questions first)
   - ❌ No → Path A or B

3. **Is the team 100% aligned on direction?**

   - ✅ Yes → Path B (start building)
   - ❌ No → Path A (get detailed specs to debate)

4. **Do you have < 2 weeks before next demo/launch?**

   - ✅ Yes → Path E (ship quick win)
   - ❌ No → Path A or B

**Default Recommendation**: Path A with `--design` flag for ideas with UI components. This gives you crisp specifications to discuss with team before committing to implementation.

## 💬 Feedback & Iteration

This brainstorm is a living document. As you implement ideas or learn more:

1. **Mark ideas as shipped**: Add ✅ and date when complete
2. **Update risk register**: Mark risks as resolved or add new ones discovered
3. **Revise effort estimates**: Actual vs estimated helps calibrate future brainstorms
4. **Track impact**: Did the idea move the North Star Metric as predicted?

**Re-brainstorm When**:

- User feedback contradicts assumptions (e.g., feature nobody uses)
- Technical constraints change (e.g., new framework available)
- Market shifts (e.g., competitor launches similar feature)
- Strategic questions get answered (may unlock new ideas)

## Template Usage Notes

### Filling This Template

1. **Replace all bracketed placeholders** with actual content
2. **Data-driven claims**: Every assertion needs evidence (git commits, user feedback, metrics, competitive examples)
3. **10x or nothing**: Ensure accepted ideas pass the 10x test (not just incremental improvements)
4. **Realistic estimates**: Apply 1.5x multiplier to optimistic estimates
5. **Strategic questions stay questions**: Don't propose solutions in the question section
